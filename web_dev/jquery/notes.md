+ Find some jquery cheat sheets
+ Figure out how you would build a calculator application using clickable divs instead of buttons and how to store data in the html content instead of in javascript variables
+ Figure out how to build a picture slider

I am going to look at my old javascript project and try to rebuild it using jquery. Then I will try to build new apps using jquery, a calculator and a picture slider. The reason why I'm starting out with rebuilding my own project is because since I already built it once, I don't have to think about how to build the app but only what jquery features I can use to enhance it. Then, I can delve deeper by trying to create something from scratch.
