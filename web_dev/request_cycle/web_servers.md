1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Linux is an open source operating system. It is run by volunteers from all over the world who contribute and ship out a release every few months. A couple of key design philosophies of the Linux operating system is that it is open-ended and feature-minded. There is a whole community that collaborates in coming up with features and then implementing the features into the system. 

Linux assumes that the user knows what they are doing, so it will do anything the user tells it to do. Because it is an open source system, anybody who knows anything can contribute to making it better. Linux gives the user great flexibility and freedom.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS allows you to manipulate an operating system on your machine, but virtually, so none of the work you do and none of the software you download on the VPS is saved in your local machine. It's very cost effective, good for scalability and easier to download software. 

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
It's considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system for security purposes. First, if you make any dangerous and irreversible changes as the root user, there is no turning back. Creating your own user will allow you to add security steps to avoid dangerous mistakes. Also, if somebody tries to install malware into your system, they have full access to your system and they can do whatever they want.
