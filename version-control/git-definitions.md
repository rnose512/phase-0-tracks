# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a system that allows you to keep track of changes that are made by having every version of a file, instead of overwriting files every time a change is made. It's useful to have every version of a file so that you can keep track of any changes that are made and be able to pinpoint a specific place when an error occurs. If you need to revert back to an older version of a file, version control allows you to do that.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a duplicate of a file. You use branches so that you can make changes without altering the original file. Once you make changes, you can merge it into the original file after reviewing that there are no mistakes. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit allows you to record changes that are made. A good commit message is concise but descriptive. It should explain specific changes that were made so that somebody else who looks at the files later on is not lost or confused. 
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict tells you if there are differences in your current branch and the base branch when you try to merge the two. If there are commits in the two working branches that do not match, you will run into a merge conflict.
