1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|3|good food, poor service|3|1|3|The Beagle Nightclub|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|5|We had the best wedding ever!|1|3|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Angela|Jolie
3|4|Amir showed up very quickly|2|2|2|Amir's Towing|2|Mandy|Kaling

2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;                      Bradford|Pitt|The Beagle Nightclub|3|good food, poor service
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|We had the best wedding ever!
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|4|Amir showed up very quickly

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
   ...> JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
   ...> WHERE businesses.name = "Amir's Towing";
3|4|Amir showed up very quickly|2|2|2|Amir's Towing|2|Mandy|Kaling
